# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary


Implement test functionality for the error reporting feature using the example from README.md. This includes setting up proper test cases for API key authorization and cache functionality.

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: Rust 1.75
**Primary Dependencies**: Axum, Tokio, Serde, Reqwest
**Storage**: In-memory cache with time-based expiration
**Testing**: cargo test
**Target Platform**: Linux server
**Project Type**: single
**Performance Goals**: 1000 req/s
**Constraints**: <200ms p95, <100MB memory
**Scale/Scope**: 10k users
## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Based on the Support Server Constitution, all implementations must adhere to these principles:
- I. Rust-First Development: All features must be implemented in Rust
- II. REST API Interface: All functionality exposed via REST API endpoints
- III. Test-First (NON-NEGOTIABLE): TDD mandatory with comprehensive unit tests
- IV. Integration Testing: Required for API contracts and external integrations
- V. Observability & Error Handling: Structured logging and proper error categorization

Additionally, all work must follow the Development Workflow and Quality Gates defined in the Constitution.

### Source Code (repository root)
<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the placeholder tree below with the concrete layout
  for this feature. Delete unused options and expand the chosen structure with
  real paths (e.g., apps/admin, packages/something). The delivered plan must
  not include Option labels.

```

**Structure Decision**: Single project structure with src/ and tests/ directories.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
